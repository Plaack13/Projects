# Projects
A collection of projects I've completed in the past, including documentation for each

Brief Descriptions:

Knapsack Project - A collection of methods to solve the famous knapsack computing problem, 
including documentation for the time real and estimated time complexity of each method. Programmed
in C++.

SweetJimmyJams - A  simple program that interacts with Spotify's API in order to recieve
information about a users playlist and store it in a local database. It then displays this 
information with a GUI developed using PyQt5. As well, it generates recommended artists for
the user based on their chosen playlists, and desired popularity for generated artist. Programmed
in Python and SQL.

ChessAI - An AI developed for a server run chess game. Important to note, not all the code uploaded to
the ChessAI.zip file is mine, but all of it is required for it to run. Specifially, in Jouer.py\games\chess\ 
I developed the ai.py and board_state.py files. These files add an AI to the game that utilizes alpha beta 
pruning, iterative depening, time limitng, and huersitic techinques to evaluate the state of the chess board
and return the most optimal move every turn.
